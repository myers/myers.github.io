[blanu][1] and I were talking about low cost computers, which would be handy for my new job (more on that later). He sent me to [idotpc.com][2] which actually has (hold on to your seat now) **[ a decent flex atx case][3] _with no ugly floppy drive hole_**. (Like I would put a 3 1/2 disk drive in a computer like that. The fact that people still use them is prove that the devil exists.) It even has USB ports on the front for game controlers. 

So now I just need a Flex ATX MB with an AGP slot (or built in 3d with a linux driver) and I can get started on a combo PVR, game system (mame + snes9x + whatever), mp3 player, picture viewer.
