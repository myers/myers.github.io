This [great summary][1] of M$'s current actions, written from the perspective of a small biz consultant (found via /.), has some great little snippets. On [billg's mug shot][2]: 

> The smiling Bill Gates mug shot from 1977 exemplifies this attitude. Microsoft claims it was for a traffic violation, but the laws of New Mexico say otherwise - mug shots are reserved for more serious offenses. What was the offense? Microsoft's money has caused that to vanish from the record. As long as money buys "justice" Microsoft will respect neither law nor justice. 

On security: 

> If you have criminal intent, or antisocial tendencies, I suppose you already know what to do and are probably already doing it.
