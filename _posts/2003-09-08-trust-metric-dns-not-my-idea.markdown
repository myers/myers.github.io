This was an idea that [raph][1] had on #p2p-hackers: Get a DNS server running (I hear Twisted has some stuff to do just this) and copy of a trustmetric like [advogato][2] and use it for a TM based DNS lookup. So for example if you lookup `zooko.myers.tm.org` you would get what ever IP that I think zooko's website lives at. Or if you try `pynk.zooko.tm.org` you would get Ben Phillip's IP, even tho zooko doesn't know Ben, but I know Ben and zooko trust me more than anyone else who knows someone name 'pynk'.
