<p>I&#8217;m in <span class="caps">IAD</span> airport on the way to Canada on Rails.  I have gummi bears (Haribo, to be exact. the <strong>good</strong> kind), coke (I don&#8217;t drink caffeine often so lightweight there too), iPod, the Rails book and a laptop. Noticably missing is internet because T-Mobile wants $10 for the hour I would be here (note to self: find out of RS has an account with them).</p>

<p>The camera is in my checked baggage or I&#8217;d share one with you to share the dullness.</p>

<p>My rental car to get from the 'burg to <span class="caps">IAD</span> was an upgrade.  Asked for compact, got the luxury (2006 Buick something-or-other).  Very nice ride.</p>

<p>Next stop is Phoenix (!!), going to see if I can get Collaboa up and running replacing the svn swig wrapper with some Ruby DL code.</p>
