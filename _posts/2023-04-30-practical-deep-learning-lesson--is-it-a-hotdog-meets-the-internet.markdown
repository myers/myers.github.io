[Practical Deep Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/) [Lesson 2](https://course.fast.ai/Lessons/lesson2.html): Let's share this with the world.

I have shipped even more ML code: [Hotdog or Not?](https://huggingface.co/spaces/myers/hotdog-or-not)

Hugging Face ðŸ¤— is darn slick.  Your project is built into a docker image and then launched as needed.  Github could learn a thing or two about showing status.  There was some errors due to the `fastai` API changing to no longer needing you to wrap an image that you want to predict in a `PILImage` and another problem with adding example images, that I solved by just removing them.
