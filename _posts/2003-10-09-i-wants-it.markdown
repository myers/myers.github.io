The [Treo 600][1] came out this week. I want it even tho it has these draw
backs:

  * _Internet is not always on_ - I don't want silly dialup like support. I
want always on broadband. With a static ip. I don't care if you have to use
IPv6 addresses either.

  * _While on the internet calls are diverted to voicemail_ - this is soooo
90's :)

  * _No built in Bluetooth_ - this is one device that could really use it.

Also it looks like someone lost me $300 by not sending in a rebate from on
time. :(
