<p>While poking about for more links about the INdTV I found a link to <a href="http://www.akimbo.com/">Akimbo</a> which has independant media via the internet straight to your TV.</p>

<p>I still think you could do a better job with an open platform (your not going to make $$ on the hardware, might as well make it open).  As far as subscriptions you sell <span class="caps">HTTP</span> passwords to the <span class="caps">RSS</span> feed of your show.</p>
