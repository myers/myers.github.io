Heck yeah. I'm something like a whole 5% scottish... at least I think... I need to do some more poking around in the family records to find out all the detail. I do know we are from the Clan Galbraith (my 2nd youngest brother, Will has Galbraith in his name, not that it's proof, just that I'm jealous). Some poking around the net finds the [clan tartan][1], and a wee bit of [history][2].
