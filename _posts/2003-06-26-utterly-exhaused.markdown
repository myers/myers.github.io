Drove 18 hours this weekend. Took both Friday and Monday off. Now 3 days of the work week just went ZOOM, when I really don't want them to go ZOOM. Things are complex at work.

Quote of the day: Donna, wife of Mike Trainum, my friend and boss, said this in response to him saying he might not be able to go on vacation: "I used to be married to a hippy".

I did get the Sanyo 8100, two of them in fact. One for Laura and one for me. Mine still is not connecting to the net but I have yet to have a moment to call SprintPCS again.
