<li>thunderbird still does not spell check the subject of emails.</li>
<li>thunderbird spell check is the worst at finding the correct options</li>
<li>mac mini&#8217;s have a <strong>STUPID</strong> cd eject button that confuses everyone I know that has one (3 different computer users).</li>
<li>HP All in One printers suck and will do crazy things on the mac then point you to do some <a href="http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?lc=en&#38;cc=us&#38;docname=c00257656&#38;product=3112">voodoo</a> to fix it.  Try to imagine how fun this is going to be to talk my grandfather through all these steps.</li>
<li>Computers suck&#8230; you stare at them all day making your eyes get  worse.  If you install software to force you to take a break you go crazy having to pause for 10 seconds ever 10 minutes.</li>
<li>QT4Java sucks.  Apple&#8217;s docs suck.</li>
</ul>
