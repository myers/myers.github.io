<p>Good lord.  What have they gotten me in to.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m sitting in the Grand Ballroom at the Roosevelt Hotel in <span class="caps">NYC</span>, maybe a 1/2 block from Grand Central.  As near as I can tell the only &#8220;practicing&#8221; geek in the room.  I say practicing because after hobnobbing with people last night I was able to see that underneath their suits there are a few former developers around here.</p>

<p>The most disheartening thing is there is <strong>NO WIFI</strong>.  About to break out the smoke signals to communicate back to the big world outside. Needless to say there is no unofficial conf. wiki or <span class="caps">IRC</span> channel.</p>

<p>In khakis and a polo shirt I&#8217;m the least dressed up person at this gig.</p>

<p>A few points from the 5 minute intro.
<ul>
<li><span class="caps">UNESCO</span> linking Cultural diversity to our survival much like Bio-diversity. </li>
<li>Only 17 countries here (there&#8217;s what? 27 countries represented at Harrisonburg Public schools?).</li>
<li>1 billion on the Internet. (North America 22%, Asia 35%, Europe 29%)</li>
</ul></p>
