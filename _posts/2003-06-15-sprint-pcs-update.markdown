I tried sending them more email thru [their "email" form][1] and realized I wasn't getting any confirmation page when I submitted the email. My guess is some silly javascript thing is not working on mozilla and messing things up. Tried it on my wife's w32-98 box with IE and lo and behold, I got a confirmation screen and tracking #. Sent them 2 emails about that and my real questions. Why are they so stupid?
