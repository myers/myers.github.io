When Sept. 11 happened I wanted to know it all. I wanted to know as much as I could find out. So a quick trip to K-Mart after my birthday dinner at Chillies got me a cable amp and some extra 75 Ohm cables and I set up this:

</a>

I was underwhelmed at how much *real* information we were getting especially after they stopped doing all news on [BBC America][3] and stopped the Canadian news on the shopping network channels. When/If I get my office setup in the garage apt. I hope to set this up again, but this time with full time feeds from BBC and [Al-Jazeera][4]. I also have some more TV's.
