Wow... weeks fly by and no posting from me. Recently I've been in meetings for 7 hours of the day and having really great profound thoughts. If I had a Wifi'ed laptop at these meetings they'd all be here, but by the time I get home (1 hour commute) I too tired to think anymore.

2 more days of meetings and I'll be working at home for my other client for a while.
