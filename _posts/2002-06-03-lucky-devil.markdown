This is from Jason, my long time friend and co-conspirator, whom I've know since [I lived overseas][1]

> Actually I'm sitting in an internet cafe in Bangkok, Thailand [...] on all someone elses tab. :) Sometimes life deals you a royal flush. This trip has been such a blast. In the last week alone I have seen the Great Wall of China, a cock fight, thousands of dirt cheap DVD's, the Forbidden Palace, met the VP for the largest telecommunications network in the Middle East and been almost killed numerous times ridding in a took-took. Asia is awesome! [...] PS. Want any DVD's? I can get Episode II for $2.

Grrr.... and I have to go to meetings....
