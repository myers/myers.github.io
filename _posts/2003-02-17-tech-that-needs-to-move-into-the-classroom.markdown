Just found a url to this article by Clay Shirky: [In-Room Chat as a Social Tool][1]. Super intresting. I would have loved something like this at any conf. I've been too, but more importantly, every college/high school class I was ever in. I have a idea that I might get to go to PNG and give some classes on Linux. I would really like to take this idea with me, but I have doubts that every student will have a pc.
