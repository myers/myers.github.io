</ul></li>
<li>iphone is way more popular than samsung blackjack

<li>but iphone is slower, has a smudge screen rather than a keyboard, doesn&#8217;t have exchange compatibility, </li>
<li>but the iphone is beautiful&#8230; &#8220;if you accidentally swallowed it, it would go right down&#8221;</li>
</ul></li>
<li>in paris, they don&#8217;t have fire escapes, because they are ugly&#8230; it&#8217;s more important to look good than to survive a fire</li>

</ul></li>
<li>the ford explorer has 88 deaths per year</li>
<li>the toyota camry has 41 deaths per year&#8230; it&#8217;s not safer to be in an <span class="caps">SUV</span>, actually&#8230; even though people <span class="caps">THINK</span> they feel safer</li>
<li>SUVs have soft corners, airbags everywhere, cupholders, and are up high.  they trick us into feeling better and safer.
<ul>
<li>web 2.0 don&#8217;t have visions, they go to parties</li>
<li>Misattribution: when you have coffee, you enjoy the movie more&#8230;  it&#8217;s not the movie, it&#8217;s the coffee!</li>
<li>ends the talk playing &#8220;Sweet Home Alabama&#8221;... that was a good talk!</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>(it was interesting, because he didn&#8217;t have a final point.  At the end he compared some blog posts that <span class="caps">DHH</span> and _why wrote about ruby and it had all these good words (passion, love, ...).  He swapped them to their antonym and labeled it Java.  I expected him to follow with telling us that there was a common misattribution with rails and these feelings and that we could find the same else where)</p>
