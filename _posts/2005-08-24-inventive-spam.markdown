<p>Musta seen Three Kings recently:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My name is Eric Joseph, I am an American soldier, I am serving in the military of the 1st Armored Division in Iraq, As you know we invade Saddam Hussien&#8217;s Home earlier in 2004,We were able to move funds belonging to Saddam Hussien&#8217;s family But we did not disclose the sum of US$25Million Dollars. We want to move this money to you, so that you may invest it for us and keep our share for banking.We have been unable to ship the consignment all this while,due to the Insurgent attacks we witness daily.We had made adequate arrangement for the cosingment to be ship since the war is partially Over.We plan on using diplomatic courier and shipping the money out in one large silver box, using diplomatic immunity.If you are interested I will send you the full details, my job is to find a good partner that we can trust and that will assist us. Can I trust you? When you receive this letter,kindly send me an e-mail signifying your interest including your most confidential telephone/fax numbers for quick  communication also your contact details. This business is risk free.  The box can be shipped out in 48hrs.Respectfully, Sgt.Eric Joseph</p>
