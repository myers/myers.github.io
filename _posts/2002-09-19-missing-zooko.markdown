I'm missing updates from zooko on his [blog][1]. He's being a good dad and making money, rather than entertaining his crazy friends on the internet with his insights, he's making money (much like I need to be a good husband and MAKE $$$ FAST). But since his blog audience includes his mom, we have some Irby updates. In the last picture on the page Irby looks much like my littlest brother, Henry (aka Henrymonkey).
