<p>Heike Caldwell, Localization Manager, Rockwell Automation. How to get Management Buy-in for Strong Localization Support.</p>

<ul>
<li>apply Lean Enterprise principles (is this like Lean Manufacturing)</li>
<li>(she&#8217;s reading right off the slides).</li>
<li>Use simple language, expect a lot of questions.</li>
<li>Why not only use English, because your competitors are doing it.</li>
<li>Rockwell only has a site in English. Globalization in progress.</li>
<li>Holistic approach. Taking into account business, region, subjects (not labeled on the slide) in a single process.</li>
<li>(I&#8217;m thinking of starting a fire to warm myself. I guess they are scared people are going to fall asleep.)</li>
<li><span class="caps">LEAN</span> Enterprise, one step below 6 Sigma (look this up).</li>
<li>(It&#8217;s a challenge to figure out how to scale down some of their solutions for RS).</li>
<li>% of overall sales vs. cost of localization: less than 1%.</li>
</ul>

<p>(so far the focus seems to be on technical products manuals, technical product marketing. I&#8217;m very unsure these approaches apply to an educational product like RS.)</p>

<ul>
<li>&#8220;we give these vendors so much business that the pricing went down&#8221;</li>
</ul>

<p>(One guys asking a question was from the World Bank, another from the European Commission)</p>

<p>(Who is our localization Czar?)</p>

<ul>
<li>The presenter is the only one doing localization full time at Rockwell.</li>
</ul>

<p>(oh look, some guy in jeans. at this point I&#8217;d rather have a parka).</p>
