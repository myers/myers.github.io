#### XBox 360

 * Dead Rising - I've been playing this off and on since 2008.  This last weekend I made a huge amount of progress, but I might have to start over due to saving when I was almost out of time for a mission.  Punishing difficulty, but it's more fun that way.
 * Dragon Age - There's no way I'll finish before Mass Effect 2 comes out this month, and I like the Mass Effect story more.  I suspect this one will be around for a while.
 * Left 4 Dead 2 - It's intense, but difficult to get the right people for a good game at expert.  Clearly I need a second TV and xbox to put in the family room.

#### D&D

Just finished a 3 year once a week campaign.  My character destroyed the universe.  Sorry about that guys.  

Started a new campaign as a Binder/Bard based way too closely on Eddie Riggs from Br√ºtal Legend.  I know it's cheep to copy, but it's fun.  Since the world he lives in looks more like the a heavy metal cover from this world his album covers will have folks in offices, staring at computers.
