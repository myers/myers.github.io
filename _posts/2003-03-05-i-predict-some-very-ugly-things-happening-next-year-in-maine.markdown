This year Maine gave laptops to all it's seventh graders, and told them that they would keep them until graduation (at which I'm sure the state would get smart and just let them have them, they wouldn't be worth much to others). Now it [plans to take them away][1] year after next. I see two things happening: 

  * iBook sales to spike as parents buy replacements 
  * Students who's families can't afford a replacement make clear to the school that they will get the laptop when they pry it from their cold dead hands 

They even have WiFi in the classroom... Now I want to go back to 7th grade.
