Last time I heard of her she was spouting off about how we need the clipper chip. Now she's quoted in [ a Washington Post story][1] about Open Source in the Armed Forces, saying that, "I've never seen a systematic study that showed open source to be more secure."

Does she work for Dr. Evil?

ps - Dorothy, why don't you do that study?
