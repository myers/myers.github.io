<h4><span class="caps">DHH</span> keynote</h4>

<ul>
<li>surplus of productivity</li>
<li>company&#8217;s needs that special in the problems we encounter</li>
<li>We ceded flexibility</li>
<li>&#8220;people like choices a lot more than they like to choose&#8221; &#8211; dhh, just now</li>
<li>why is this not in the framework, someone make this choice for me</li>
<li>we decided tech matters</li>
<li>&#8220;great people rarely fail because of poor technology&#8221; &#8211; but come on, do you want to just &#8220;not fail&#8221;?</li>
<li>we cared about us</li>
<li>&#8220;ruby is designed to make programmers happy&#8221; &#8211; matz</li>
<li>the surplus will not last forever
<ul>
<li>why? the mainstream will copy rails (dhh doesn&#8217;t think so)</li>
<li>dramatic alternative arrives (dhh doesn&#8217;t think so)</li>
<li>rails becomes the mainstream</li>
</ul></li>
<li>business as usual &#8211; which is blowing your surplus, running at 110% all the time</li>
<li>another day, another fire</li>
<li>Lost in the mechanics &#8211; when running at 110% means you can&#8217;t see anything else</li>
<li>fatigued, disinterested, passionless</li>
<li>it&#8217;s just a job &#8211; most depressing statement</li>
<li>one place to invest that will pay back: you</li>
<li>1:10 programmer productivity</li>
<li>no one is born a rock star programmer, you become it</li>
<li>recharge tangentially &#8211; or some other word, do something else besides sit in front of a computer all day: making spoons, play the banjo, fly a plane </li>
<li>can&#8217;t just focus on one muscle</li>
<li>speaking about taking people to the next level: sleep more (applause)</li>
<li>stop to read paper</li>
<li>suggested reading
<ul>
<li>my job went to india (and all i got was this lousy book)</li>
<li>implementation patterns</li>
<li>innovator&#8217;s dilemma</li>
<li>tufte&#8217;s envisioning information</li>
</ul></li>
<li>all this helps you judge what is valuable or not</li>
<li>is this lack of a seam on the iphone what matters.</li>
<li>program less</li>
<li>when you have only 10 hours to program a week, you know what matters</li>
<li>sometimes good to start a project from scratch</li>
<li>share: you benefit from the sharing</li>
<li>&#8220;the purpose of playing this game well is to be able to get the best position of the next game&#8221; &#8211; alistair cockburn, 1999</li>
<li>4 day work week means more focus</li>
<li>summary: this surplus is not going to last forever don&#8217;t blow it all on hookers and fur coats</li>
</ul>
