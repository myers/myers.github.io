<p>So&#8230; there&#8217;s over a year gap between this post and the last.  At some point my email to blog script broke and I was just too damn busy to fix it.  The week the server I was running the blog broke and I had to move the services on it.   While in NY last year I wrote a blog using <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>, and while installing the new server I installed that and polished it up a bit.  Goodbye pybloxom, I never did submit all the patches I wrote for you.</p>

<p>I need to clean up a bit of spam on this site.  Seems like some spammers found my trac sites for some of the projects I had listed here and had a little fun.  I have two trac.db files that are 300mb full of spam.  </p>

<p>Shouts out to Steven N. and Zooko. </p>
