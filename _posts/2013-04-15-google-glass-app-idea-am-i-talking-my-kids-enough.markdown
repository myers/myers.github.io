[The Power of Talking to Your Baby](http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/10/the-power-of-talking-to-your-baby/)

> If you haven’t heard of Hart and Risley’s work, you are not alone — and you may be wondering why. These findings should have created a policy whirlwind: Here was a revolutionary way to reduce inequities in school achievement that seemed actually possible. How hard could it be to persuade poor parents to talk to their children more?

> Very hard, it turned out — because there was no practical way to measure how much parents talk. Each hour of recording took many hours to transcribe and classify: to count the words uttered near a child and attribute them to a parent, the main child, a sibling, someone else or a TV. The cost was prohibitive.

With [Google Glass](http://www.google.com/glass/start/) you could monitor everything you say, you could track if your kids are around you.
