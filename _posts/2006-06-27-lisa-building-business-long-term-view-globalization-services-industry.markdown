<p>April Singer, 20-year localization veteran from <span class="caps">IBM</span>. How to convince your org. to globalize.</p>

<ul>
<li>Nokia <span class="caps">CTO</span> &#8211; world will be defined not by geography but by the 'Net. *Non-G8 (had some other term I didn&#8217;t catch) countries will double the % of their <span class="caps">GDP</span> and become competitors and consumers by (some date). </li>
<li>McKinsey Quarterly (look this up) 8 out of 10 top trends revolved around globalization. </li>
<li><span class="caps">IBM</span> <span class="caps">CEO</span> to London Fin Times: not a US company doing biz in China, but a borderless company who looks to locals as a local company.</li>
<li>(I&#8217;m wishing I packed a sweater about now)</li>
<li>How are we going to pretend to be a global company if the first thing we do is screw up our website?</li>
<li>Google, Yahoo, eBay say their are having problems with globalization.</li>
<li>(I think RS needs a &#8220;customer advocate&#8221; for each language we launch into)</li>
<li>(I wish I could pull the slides I have into this post. )</li>
<li>Rob Glaser, <span class="caps">CEO</span>, Real Networks &#8211; Customer good will is key to what makes customers gravitate towards one product or another. (this is hystraical coming from the company who I will never install software for. Maybe they are waking up to the fact they have cased off their customers with bad will).</li>
<li>(take a look at <span class="caps">IBM</span>.com and it&#8217;s locale segmentation scheme)</li>
<li><span class="caps">IBM</span> thinks they can help us all. &#8220;If you are growing too fast&#8221; (they could help soak up that excess cash? ;)</li>
<li><span class="caps">IBM</span> said their will be one e-experience, one host, (see slide &#8220;Mission of <span class="caps">IBM</span>.com&#8221;)</li>
<li>&#8220;We can&#8217;t possibly meet this demand [for globalization services]&#8221;. (If that is the case why are their only 70 people in this room? I don&#8217;t doubt this is important, but perhaps this conf. didn&#8217;t fit in the schedules of the masses working on this at breakneck speed. I know I felt that I should be back in H&#8217;burg working on our .de site).</li>
<li>(ended with a 15 min QA)</li>
<li>(It&#8217;s so cold in this room that my breath is fogging up my glasses)</li>
<li>One Q: if you were in the $500M space, what would you do:* What do you do best? pick your niche, be the best in your space * Work with local, knowledgeable resources.</li>
<li>(how was our call center contract in <span class="caps">EMEA</span> picked?)</li>
<li>Q: One of your goals was a rapidly deployable site, what time frame are we talking about. A: 2 weeks for a site like one we already have.</li>
</ul>
