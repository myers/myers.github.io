Reading [Martin Peck's blog][1] tonight. I must say he's hit the nail on the head in [ this entry][2] about what I am trying to do with my own work in p2p networks. It's all about building [Doc Searl's][3] favorite word: [ _infrastructure_][4].

Hopefully we can get "Mnet Roadmap" out soon so I can outline where I want to go building infrastructure with Mnet.
