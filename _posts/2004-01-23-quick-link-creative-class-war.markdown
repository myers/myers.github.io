[ Creative Class War][1] from Washington Monthly

> But having talked to hundreds of talented professionals in a half dozen
> countries over the past year, I'm convinced that the biggest reason has to do
> with the changed political and policy landscape in Washington. In the 1990s,
> the federal government focused on expanding America's human capital and
> interconnectedness to the world--crafting international trade agreements,
> investing in cutting edge R&D, subsidizing higher education and public access
> to the Internet, and encouraging immigration. But in the last three years, the
> government's attention and resources have shifted to older sectors of the
> economy, with tariff protection and subsidies to extractive industries.
>
> Meanwhile, Washington has stunned scientists across the world with its
> disregard for consensus scientific views when those views conflict with the
> interests of favored sectors (as has been the case with the issue of global
> climate change). Most of all, in the wake of 9/11, Washington has inspired the
> fury of the world, especially of its educated classes, with its my-way-or-the-
> highway foreign policy. In effect, for the first time in our history, we're
> saying to highly mobile and very finicky global talent, "You don't belong
> here."
