<p><a href="http://www.prismiq.com/">prismiq</a> looks like it might work out.  They have a beta linux server program.  I still would like to have a quite full blown pc under the TV, but $400 vs $150?</p>

<p>Another downside for prismiq is no Games.  With console emulators and <span class="caps">MAME</span> you can have a pretty vast game collection on tap.</p>
