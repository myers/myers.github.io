Finally SprintPCS got a palm based phone with CDMA 1xRTT: [the i330][1] Amazon won't let you add phones to your wishlist, but should anyone have $500 to drop on a present for me, you can still give me a christmas present. 

This is really a general purpose computer masked as a moble phone with high speed data access. It's like we're living in the future! 

It has a camera and keyboard options, so don't forget to get me those as well. Maybe I don't need a laptop!
