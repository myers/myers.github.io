Tonite, my prefered browser isn't working to well. Galeon is crashing when I switch windows. Quite odd as it work before and the only thing I can think of that I changed is the window manager (gnome/sawfish to icewm).

In the mean time I'm reading stuff via [Dillo][1] which works amazingly well for being 300kb in size.
