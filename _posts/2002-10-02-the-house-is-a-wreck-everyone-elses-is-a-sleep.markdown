... and I sit here reading about [the Danger Hiptop][1]. I was disappointed that T-Mobil doesn't have coverage in C'ville, so I'll have to wait for the CDMA2k version and Sprint PCS to license it. All I know is that if they get a ssh client I'm sold. And that should be too hard has you should only have to port [MindTerm][2] to the mutant version of Java that the Hiptop runs. Actually the *only* think wrong with the Hiptop is the closed platform, but perhaps that's what it takes to get the big stupid phone co's to spring for it.
