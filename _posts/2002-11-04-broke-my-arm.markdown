While pitching a chair from the back of a pickup truck I lost my balance and fell backwards. Using my ninja skills I prevented a head injury with my arm and got a [Radial Head Fracture][1] for my trouble. I didn't even know it was broken until about 2 hours later when I started wondering why my arm was still hurting and went looking on the net for answers (after I couldn't get Jason on the phone).

Typing w/ one hand sucks so tata4now.
