title: "Too many window types!!!"

Tonight I'm frustrated with my GUI set up: I have too many window types. We have 

  1. Normal X windows 
  2. PowerShell Tabs 
  3. Joe windows 

I get lost remembering which key to hit to switch back to the last window. 

If my gnome panel (which runs down the right side of my screen, where my mouse still naturaly goes to after so many years of not using a mac) wasn't already full of konq windows, I would switch to rxvt some gui text editor.
