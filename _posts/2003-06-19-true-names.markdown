Back from the library. Both Laura and I feel like we spent money, because we got such cool books. I got one of the Foundation books on tape (13 hours!), for tomorrows 8 hour trip and Sunday's 8 hour return trip. Also got two book by Vernor Vinge. [zooko][1] has told that I will greatly enjoy Vinge, and I can't wait to dig into them.
