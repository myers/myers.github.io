I've often seen people post their Myers-Briggs test results, as if it would somehow explain who they are to the rest of the world. Salon has an [interview with the author of a book that it's BS][1], that many personality the test don't match up to reality.

There again, a lot of personality tests are very unreliable, in part because people are complicated and dynamic and do change over time and according to situation. Proponents of the Myers-Briggs will tell you that your personality type, as represented by the four dimensions, is inborn and unchanging. But in fact, research shows that when given more than once to the same person, as many as 75 percent of test takers will get a different personality type on the second administration.
