Zooko moved from Halfax, NS to Toronto a week ago. He hasn't gotten back on the net yet, but he was supposed to get DSL today. Unfortunately Canadian DSL providers are just as bad as US providers and thus, no zooko.

When he gets back we will push out a new Mnet release. If he doesn't show by Saturday I'll do the Mnet release. I really want to tear in the Unstable branch and fix what I can.
