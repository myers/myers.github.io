Zeke and Jessie came over the mountain this Saturday as part of my wife's evil plan to surprise me for my birthday. Zeke was poking thru my comic collection and started looking at [Transmetropolitian][1]. He then stopped dead in his tracks and read the first trade paperback. I think he liked it. He borrowed the rest of what I have (if someone can buy me issues 46-60 I'd love you forever) and they are now spreading around Harrisonburg to all of his friends.

So I started poking around finding other stuff by Warren Ellis, the writer/owner of TransMet and found some other stuff by him. I found one comic online: [SuperIdol][2], you need to know what a meme is. Here's the best definition I found on the first page of search results on google (from [this page][3]):

> meme: (pron. 'meem') A contagious idea that replicates like a virus, passed on from mind to mind. Memes function the same way genes and viruses do, propagating through communication networks and face-to-face contact between people. The root of the word "memetics," a field of study which postulates that the meme is the basic unit of cultural evolution. Examples of memes include melodies, icons, fashion statements and phrases.
