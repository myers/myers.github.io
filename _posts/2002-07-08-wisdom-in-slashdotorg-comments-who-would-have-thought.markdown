I really liked this [comment from /.][1]

> _No, it means capitalism lost :)_

> Actually, it was "corporatism" that brought on this failure, not "capitalism". We've been moving away from capitalism here in America since the 1978 Supreme Court decision that defined corporate political donations as "free speech". Our biggest corporations essentially bought the 1980 elections after that decision.

> That's when these corporations began a major paradigm shift away from "maximizing profits" and towards "controlling markets". Capitalism requires free markets, and doesn't function in controlled markets.
