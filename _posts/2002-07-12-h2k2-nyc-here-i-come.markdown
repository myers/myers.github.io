In a few hours I will be heading off to NYC with Jason to check out [H2K2][1]. I hope to meat a few people I know from online (esp. Artimage, a new MNet hacker). 

If you would like to meat up [email me][2], and I hope to get it via Jason's laptop and 802.11b. 

I'm making a CD for him with all the essentials, python, 802.11b sniffer, mnet source code, cygwin, mingw.
