Laura's brother is in El Salvador with the Peace Core. Laura and I hooked him up with a blog: [AdventuresOfBob.com][1], and he's been posting to it lately. We are still doing some work on it, for example I want to make the site look like and [Indiana Jones poster][2]

Laura also has a blog, but I don't think she has been thinking about it. 

He writes really, really long posts about what's going on there. And he's been adding [pictures][3] to it as well. 

We are planning to visit him in October. Tickets are cheap (~$300/person) 

Which reminds me I need to burn Bob some CD's of mp3's he wanted (he only has 33.6 connection on a shared phone line). I remember what it was like to be in media starvation while I lived in PNG. I need to keep remembering so I will get my act together and mail the CD's to him. 

Also, does anyone out there are a Spanish Windows 98 license they are not using any more?
