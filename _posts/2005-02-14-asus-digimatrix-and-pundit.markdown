<p>I&#8217;m dreaming that I had more $$ than I do, and thinking about buying a media box.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.asus.com/products/desktop/pundit/overview.htm"><span class="caps">ASUS</span> Pundit</a>.  This would be great for watching video from the internet  on TV and all the other options freevo/mythtv.  Throw in a wintv card and <br />you have a remote and tv recording.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.asus.com/products/desktop/digimatrix/overview.htm"><span class="caps">ASUS</span> DigiMatrix</a>.  Built in everything.  $100 more.</p>

<p>The perplexing thing to me is both have digital audio out (S/<span class="caps">PDIF</span> also know as TosLink), but they are on the front of the unit.  If I where spending tons of $$ for a media room I would want a <span class="caps">DVI</span> projector and digital audio.  Seems having the S/<span class="caps">PDIF</span> out on the back of both units would make a lot more sense.</p>
