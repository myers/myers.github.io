<p>So&#8230;. banks suck.  I arrive here late at night and misremember my pin, and they lock out my card.  That feels good.  Call up my bank and they are closed.  Fortunately a call to Laura sorts out something that works.  40 Canadian pesos out of the <span class="caps">ATM</span> and I can get to the hotel.</p>

<p>Vancouver is this dark black hole.  I&#8217;m sure this has nothing to do with the fact it&#8217;s night time.  I&#8217;m sure it is always like this&#8230;  dark.  Lights on the edge of blackness.  I fully expect to find a black hole out there in the morning.</p>

<p>Get off the airplane and someone behind me starts singing &#8220;Blame Canada&#8221;.</p>

<p>So, this thought went thru my head: Python = Snake, speaking snake is Parseltongue, Ruby = Red, Red = Gryphindor&#8217;s color, Harry Potter wears glasses, <strong>I</strong> wear glases, I also speak python and hang out with the Ruby guys&#8230;. so I&#8217;m the Harry F-ing Potter of Rosetta Stone?</p>

<p>Tomorrow I join the Royal Canadien Kilted Yaksmen or see David Heinemeier Hansson, one of the two, it&#8217;s becoming fuzzy.</p>
