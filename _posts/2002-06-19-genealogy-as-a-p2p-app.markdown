For a long time I've been thinking about setting up a genealogy website for my families. I've also thought about how that my website should only have to keep so much information on it, because I'm really not intrested that my great-great-great-great-great- great-great-great-grandfather's half brother's illgitmate child had 12 kids, one of whom died in 1800's sometime. I also don't want to have to track my family back to the 1500's if someone else has done it. Enter p2p tech. 

There are lots of twists and turns to figure out how this might be done decentrailized, but today while poking around I found [Genealogy Network Transfer Protocol][1], a project on sf.net, which hasn't been updated in an while. Started unsurprisingly by the [mormons][2] (who believe they can save their ancestors by praying for them), it might be a good start. 

Add that to my todo list.
