<p>Yesterday while sitting in a talk about getting into embedded systems by monitoring the output buses, the wifi flaked out.  It has been coming and going all the time.</p>

<p>Fortunately, we had a 3G cdma phone w/ 1xRTT.  A 15 minutes of putting stuff together, <a href="http://thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/doc.html">dnsmasq</a>, the iptables config from my home server, and some tinkering with iwconfig, we had a ad-hoc network with Internet access.</p>

<p>At the high point we had 4 people connected via my computer.  1xRTT is not good for sharing, as no one really had good performance. But it was fun.  Fun is good.</p>
