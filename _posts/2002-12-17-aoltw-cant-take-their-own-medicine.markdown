So the new version of Netscape will have Mozilla's popup blocking [except...][1]

> Users that activate the pop-up suppression on the latest version of Netscape will find that a number of sites have been excluded from the block. Seven of these 15 exceptions relate to sites that belong to AOL Time Warner, including aol.com, aim.com and cnn.com. However, the consumer has the option of removing the exceptions and applying a blanket ban on pop-up ads.

What cowards.
