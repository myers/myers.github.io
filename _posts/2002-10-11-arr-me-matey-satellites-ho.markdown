[2600][1] has an [interesting article][2] up about a current General Accounting Office report that says most satellites have next to no security. Anyone with the right equipment can send them commands. Ouch! Even more intresting is the [link][3] to article about a brit hacker who claims to be reciving "American surveillance pictures relayed from US spy planes". There's some "Must see TV"!
