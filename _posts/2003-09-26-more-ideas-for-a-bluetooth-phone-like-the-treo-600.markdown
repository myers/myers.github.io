An idea I had while walking out of the office, "I wish my IM's would get redirected to me right after I walk out". So with Bluetooth you could have your phone say hello to the computer you are sitting at and say, "sign on to IM agent", and then if the phone can't talk to the computer for 1 minute, it signs on to the IM agent and kicks off the other computer. 

Another idea is having the phone store your password/ssh/gpg keyring, and maybe even do the crypto ops on the phone via bluetooth.
