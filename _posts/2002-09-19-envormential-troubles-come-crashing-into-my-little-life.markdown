Big things affect little people, I'm learning. Today [Charlottesville goes into phase 2 water restrictions][1]. This directly effects me it that one of Laura's jobs is at a plant nursery, and if I understand her right, they will be asked not to water their plants any more. The business at the nursery has already been slowing down, some because it's the end of planting season, but a lot because no one is allowed to water their gardens. They do a lot of business landscaping as well, and that has compeletely dropped off.

While [some say][1] this is the worst in 50 years, it's hard to say that this is caused by us puny humans. But if it is our descendants are not going to like us.
