Way back in 1995-96, I lost my Mac religion. This was a big change for me, but I think [this comic][1] describes it best. Also I liked the idea of linux, because if there was a screamingly apparent problem (like one app crashing bring down the whole system) it would get fixed _with in months_, not when someone at Apple got a clue, which took them **_6 years!_**.

Now, hopefully cluefulness will rule at Apple for a while. My wife says she wants a Mac for her new computer. I want to have one too, so **I** can play with it.
