[Film Gimp - Lights, Camera, Linux!][1]: Cool... gimp and linux used all over the movie industry. Most intresting tidbit is this:

> Some years ago I built an automatic television news monitoring system for DARPA that used a PC to record CNN-TV off the air. My PVR was before TiVo, but for the military. It did natural language parsing on the closed-captioning and would notify military analysts as soon as any story on a relevant topic aired. It also deleted off-topic stories to conserve storage. I'm developing a similar approach to prioritize and cull email.

I need one of these for my [warroom][2].
