<p>I&#8217;m about 1/4 of the way into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_League_of_Extraordinary_Gentlemen:_The_Black_Dossier">League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: Black Dossier</a> somewhere in the supposed play by Shakespeare revealing the first 007, oh what a trip.  Strongly recommended.</p>
