<blockquote>
<p>Honey has completed her first project for me: research on the person Esquire has chosen as the Sexiest Woman Alive. (See page 232.) I&#8217;ve been assigned to write a profile of this woman, and I really don&#8217;t want to have to slog through all the heavy-breathing fan Web sites about her. When I open Honey&#8217;s file, I have this reaction: America is fucked. There are charts. There are section headers. There is a well-organized breakdown of her pets, measurements, and favorite foods (e.g., swordfish). If all Bangalorians are like Honey, I pity Americans about to graduate college. They&#8217;re up against a hungry, polite, Excel-proficient Indian army. Put it this way: Honey ends her emails with &#8220;Right time for right action, starts now!&#8221; Your average American assistant believes the &#8220;right time for right action&#8221; starts after a Starbucks venti latte and a discussion of last night&#8217;s Amazing Race 8.</p>
