<p>from <a href="http://reddit.com/">reddit</a> <a href="http://dmiessler.com/blogarchive/ron-paul-is-not-a-great-candidate-were-just-so-in-love-with-him-that-were-not-paying-attention">Ron Paul is Seriously Flawed as a Candidate; We’re Just So in Love With Him That We’re Not Paying Attention</a> &#8230;. Except everything they list as reasons he&#8217;s flawed I agree with.  It&#8217;s just more reasons to love the guy.</p>
