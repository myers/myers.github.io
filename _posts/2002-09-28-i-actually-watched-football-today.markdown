So the first plans for today were to start packing. We get the house Tuesday, and loose the apt on next Monday, giving us a week to move out and clean up the apt. And maybe I could have looked in on the Mnet hack day event that is supposed to happen every Saturday. 

Then Jason called and said that he was closing on a house and wanted to move this weekend and only had the weekend to get it all done before he started his next rotation that was a lot more hellish than the current (he is a resident in Norfolk, VA. The pain hospitals put medical residents thru should be illegal). 

THEN my grandparent's plans to visit Charlottesville and go to a football game at VMI, where my cousin, David Latimer ([link][1] to his teams roster on ESPN) would be playing for Furman against VMI, worked out and we chose that. 

Laura and I had a lot of fun. David made some great tackles and a interception. I greatly enjoyed being with both my grandparents and my great aunt and uncle. 

I brought my cell and a prepaid calling card with the thought of maybe calling zooko and saying hey, but I got pretty into the game. Even ignored a [paper][2] on Tarzan, the anonymoizing p2p IP layer. 

What I really need is a cellphone/pda that can send and receive packets. :)
