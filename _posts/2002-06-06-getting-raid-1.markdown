Recent events have proved that hard drives suck sooo... Tell me how to get [RAID 1][1]. 

You could do it in software or your could get a [ $50 dollar card][2] that does ATA 100 as well. I would like to go this route since my motherboard only does ATA 33 

Next you need a matching hard drive to what you already have. Here's what I want [ Maxtor DIMONDMAX + 80GB][3]. 

Now... I just need some money....
