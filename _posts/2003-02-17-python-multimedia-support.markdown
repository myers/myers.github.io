In [this interview][1] with Guido van Rossum he mentioned his declining intresting in Python multimedia stuff in the std lib. I think this is a pity. I could really do with a standard way to output audio in all platforms (libao doesn't cut it, it's GPL). Also I would love a standard API for reading, seeking and getting metadata out of audio files.
