After reading this [interview with Bev Harris][1] about her research into
[Black box voting][2], I decided to call my [local registare of voters][3],
and asked them what voting machine they use, if they had any plans to replace
them, and if they knew about the Diebold controversy. They answered: [ AVC
Advantage][4] (which I plan to read a bit more about), no plans to replace
them, and they did now about the Diebold mess.
