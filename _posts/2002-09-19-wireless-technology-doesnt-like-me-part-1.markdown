I ordered a 802.11b access point (D-Link DWL-900ap) and pc card (USR 2410) with money I got for my birthday. They arrived today, one day before the UPS tracker said they would. I opened the boxes, plugged in the AP to ethernet and power, popped the pc card in, *beep* *beep*, linux recongnized the card, got an ip address and it just worked. Very cool. Possibly the easiest hardware install I've had in years. 

I went out on to the porch and tried using [bing][1], a bandwidth testing tool to see what the transfer rate was and *boom* no more link. Looking at the access point showed the WLAN light lit soldly (it was blinking before). Unplug the AP, plug it back in... same thing. I monkied with it for a while and then called Tech support. After a few minutes on the phone (it which they wanted to know a lot of details about my network, "what kind of router do you have?") they said "send it back". Grrr! 

So the question is: Did bing kill it? or was the hardware defective? Quite odd. Not sure if I'll run bing when I get the replacement. 

Also no luck on getting [kismet][2] running with the pc card.
