[Why your Movable Type blog must die][1]:

>   You are all pretentious twats
> 
> Every last one of you. You're all latte-sipping, iMac-using, suburban-living tertiary-industry-working WASPs who offer absolutely no new insights on anything whatsoever apart from maybe one specialist field if we're lucky. Most of you think that you're writing original content and that you're making a contribution by licensing your spewings under Creative Commons "Some Rights Reserved" licences, just because it's the hip thing to do.  

Made my latte come out my nose (j/k: Drinking Latte's would mean I couldn't sleep for the next 18 hours, so avoid them)
