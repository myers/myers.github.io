Wow. [These guys][1] are claiming they are gathering stats on most p2p user.
What's intresting is they must have reverse engineered the kazaa stuff long
before the open source community did. It also would seem that they are
probably running Kazaa Supernodes in order to get this info, thus helping
Kazaa users download stuff that the RIAA would rather they not. I bet they
don't tell their customers that.

I don't think a company like this could exists if something like Overnet
became more common place.
