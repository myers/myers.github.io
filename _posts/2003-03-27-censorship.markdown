There may be a good reason to go to war (to get rid of an abusive leader), but the pro war faction of this country does not win over the hearts and minds of the antiwar by censoring them. As I heard on [Democracy Now!][1] this morning Ani DeFranko was told by a concert venue owned by Clear Channel that she had to agree not to say anything about politics, or the she could not use the venue. 

Not that I'm saying Clear Channel does not have a legal right to do this.
