Yesterday at work we needed more XP the OS and XP the Office Suite licences to install. Little did I know that you could buy [just the licences][1]. How weird. It's been a long time since I actually bought software. 

I attempted to talk the work guys into getting Linux and OpenOffice, but they wanted to spend $300 (and I really actually didn't want to deal with it if it went wrong).
