The RIAA finally says [Illegal music sites 'here to stay'][1]. Wonder what this means for their stream of lawsuits? Also they've been effective at shutting down a lot of college students from using P2P apps, but the worrysome thing for me, a p2p developer, is they might go after us. Or rather individuals like myself.
