One of my favorite authors, [Warren Ellis][1], linked an an article about
dying languages, a topic dear to my heart. I work at [Shellbook Publishing
Systems][2] were we are writing a program that might go along what to preserve
these languages. The idea is that a person understands information best in
their mother tongue, and 20 percent of the world's population speak one of
6,000 lesser-known languages. Our software enables speakers of these smaller
languages to adapt books into their own language.

Um, speaking of which I have deadline tomorrow, so back to the dungon...
