Two articles worth reading:

[Technologists Claim KaZaA Can Filter Copyrighted Works][1]: Someone finally
points out Kazaa could be using content fingerprinting, like the [TRM][2] that
[MusicBrainz][3] uses to help users tag their music files. Unfortunatly I
don't see how this would help the content industry if all Kazaa clients were
open source (which they all would be pretty quick if something like this was
added to Kazaa).

[Building bridges between P2P networks][4]: A great idea. I use [MLDonkey][5]
to get stuff off eDonkey and Kazaa. One of the things we are doing in
[Mnet][6] is use the [CP2PC][7] interface to our daemon. Now that [giFT][8]
has Kazaa and soon eDonkey it would be neat to use [xmlrpc-c][9] to add a
CP2PC interface to giFT.
