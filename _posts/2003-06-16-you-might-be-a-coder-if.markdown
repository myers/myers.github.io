So lately I've been a code consumer while at home (at work I'm still attempting to stay sane while cleaning up a poorly written web store that on top of that is in a poorly designed (or in this case evolved) language: VBScript), playing GTA: Vice City. Last night I realized I while I was flying down the west island on a PCJ crotch rocket that thinking of how exactly the data structures that made up VC might work.

So far I've only come up with 1 bug in VC that annoys me: persistance. I cannot figure out all the rules there are to if a car is going to stay in existance if I walk 100m away from it or not.
