<p>Aside from my &#8220;amazon wish list&#8221;:http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/registry.html/002-9667547-1938447?%5Fencoding=UTF8&id=3JYVDAXJZBNPD , I want an <span class="caps">RFID</span> scanner, that I can install around my front door (so it must blend in).  I want to know what <span class="caps">RFID</span> tags there are out there, and where they are coming from.  Google doesn&#8217;t show up anything like a <span class="caps">RFID</span> scanner that can be put in a doorway.</p>

<p>While poking around ebay for <span class="caps">RFID</span> I got this: <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&#38;category=26261&#38;item=3857667855&#38;rd=1">VeriChip TXI400L Implantable Security Microchip with Injector Kit</a>.  I guess you could give me one of these and we could inject the cats!</p>
