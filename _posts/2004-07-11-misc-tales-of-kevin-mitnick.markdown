<p>On Friday we were drinking at the Irish bar next to the hotel.  Kevin showed up about 1am but the music was too loud to have a good conversation.  After about 10 request to turn it down they finally did.</p>

<p>Palm needs a new ad for the Treo 600, something like &#8220;Got 600&#8221;.  Kevin can be the first one, as he has a <span class="caps">GSM</span> model.</p>

<p>Kevin had given the <a href="http://www.applefritter.com/node/view/3686">keynote</a> for the day, and someone asked him if anyone had asked him to sign anything unusual.  Some girl had asked for him to sign her bra.  During<br />the <a href="http://www.applefritter.com/node/view/3691">Woz</a> keynotes] Geo and I got separated from Jason, who went down and tried his hand at lock picking (poker, lock picking&#8230;. I think he&#8217;srounding up his abilities to be a bad influence before becoming a father).  Riding back up on the elevator the woman in question was on<br />board, and talking to friend with her, she said &#8220;Kevin signed my bra, do you want to see?&#8221; then flashing her bra to everyone on the elevator.</p>

<p>Remind me not to lose Jason next time.  He finds interesting things.</p>
