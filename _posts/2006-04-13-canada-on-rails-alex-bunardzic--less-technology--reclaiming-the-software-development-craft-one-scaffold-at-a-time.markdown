<p><em>just starting out&#8230;. title sounds interesting</em></p>

<p><em>after this I don&#8217;t know what to do&#8230; really tired but I&#8217;d love to look around.  On the other hand sushi and sleep sounds very nice now</em></p>

<ul>
<li>taking the lighter dept.  No more code snippets tonight.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m an artist my whole life. (shows drawing of his grandmother)</li>
<li>Zen teacher</li>
<li>I am clueless.  The more I learn the less I know.  Beginners mind has endless possibility.  Experts mind is full of crap.</li>
<li>Clueless = going with the flow</li>
<li>pre-emptive lets go of the assumptions</li>
<li>focus on the language</li>
<li>carpenters vs. luthiers (instrument builders)</li>
<li>the &#8220;less code&#8221; movement</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Update: I didn&#8217;t get the sense that anyone liked this talk much</em></p>
