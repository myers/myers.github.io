Laura and I might be moving at the end of Sept. Laura's cousin has an aunt (on the side of the family not related to Laura) that owns 40 acres in Ivy with two small houses on it. One of these house is about 100 years old (we think), and the tenant is moving out. Here is a picture of the house:

The bad thing is we have to break the lease on our current apartment with a two month rent penalty charge. The good thing is our rent will be going down and we can actually start saving some money. Oh, yeah, that and this place has much more class.
