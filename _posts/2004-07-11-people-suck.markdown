<p>There&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.the-fifth-hope.org/5hwiki/RecentChanges">wiki up for the con</a>, but as you can see on the <a href="http://www.the-fifth-hope.org/5hwiki/RecentChanges">Recent Changes</a> page, I&#8217;m one of the most active users (of 3 or so).  Maybe because I&#8217;m hacking too much and  not paying attention to the current talk.  It would be nice if the 2600 crew would push the wiki more so that all the talks would get their own page with links to the slides, etc.</p>

<p>(humm&#8230; I suppose I should become the media, as this t-shirt says, and start collecting the info myself&#8230;)</p>

<p>Also, I really wish I had a zeroconf/ichat app to set up an ad-hoc conf room.  Started on it yesterday, but the <a href="http://twistedmatrix.com/">Twisted</a> api for both didn&#8217;t make sense when I was doing it.</p>

<p>No more ethereal people, use your blogging tools! :P</p>
