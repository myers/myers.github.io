I found a way on some other site how to remap caps lock to ctrl in windows xp.
Putting it here so I can get to it later, now that my brain has it remapped in
my head. The two links below are regedit files. I don't know if I've tested
the file that clears the remap, but I'm pretty sure it works.

[caps_lock_to_ctrl.reg][1]

[clear_remapings.reg][2]

   [2]: /2004/03/14/clear_remapings.reg
