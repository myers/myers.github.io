<p><blockquote>[arma] i think we live in a parallel unauthorized copy of earth. crop circles are the tell-tale signs of break-in.</p>

<p>[arma] (speaking of digital rights management)</p>

<p>[coderman] lol</p>

<p>[tvoj] 34Rth 1z mY w4r3Z!!!!</p>

<ul>
<li>tvoj has been reading too much <a href="http://www.rdwarf.com/~kioh/">H4&#215;0r Economist</a></li>
</ul>

<p>[tvoj] arma: how kn i use UR crop-cirlce algo to h4ck pr0n?</p>

<p>[arma] well, the theory is, the watermarks are indistinguishable while they&#8217;re working,</p>

<p>[arma] but since obviously people have been removing watermark-sized pieces of corn fields,</p>

<p>[arma] then pretty soon we&#8217;re no longer going to have control over those fields.</p>

<p>[arma] ...the implications for hacking porn should be obvious.</p>

<p>[arma] i can give you a hint, if you need it:</p>

<p>[tvoj] arma: kn U send m3 sum l337 KoRn?</p>

<p>[arma] step 1: place crop circles in porn</p>

<p>[arma] step 3: profit.</p>

<p>[tvoj] U r g3nus.</p>

<p>[tvoj] arma: i tried k0rn pr0n but all i got was bitchslapped with a trout. was this success?</p>

<p>[arma] you must keep trying.</p>

<p>[tvoj] shite h4xx0R1ng iz fuct</p>

<p>[arma] perhaps you should read a book? take a walk?<br /></blockquote></p>
