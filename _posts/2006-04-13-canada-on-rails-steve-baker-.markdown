<p>_I think this is <a href="http://blog.lavalamp.ca/_">his blog</a></p>

<ul>
<li>Full time Rails developer.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m good at talking, but bad at slides.  Lack of profanity or pornography in the slides.</li>
<li><span class="caps">TDD</span> is about Specification not Verification</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Chai is good.  Makes the body feel warm and my brain feel cushioned</em></p>

<ul>
<li>When changing your software change the tests first</li>
</ul>

<p><em>He recapped a lot of what was covered in the testing chapter of the Rails book</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Tests mean that while you are writing your main code you know what to do next.</li>
<li>Writing Ruby Support for <a href="http://www.openqa.org/selenium/">Selenium</a></li>
</ul>

<h4>Q&A</h4>

<ul>
<li><em>lot&#8217;s of questions about <span class="caps">TDD</span> and if it was really useful and how to apply to their situation.</em></li>
<li><em>How to get <span class="caps">TDD</span> working at his job:</em> &#8220;I just made sure everyone knew I thought they were stupid for not writing tests.&#8221; <em>Humm sounds like someone I know (*cough* Doug <strong>cough</strong>).</em></li>
</ul>

<p><em>Listening to people having a hard sell to get their bosses to allow <span class="caps">TDD</span> makes me glad to work at RS</em></p>
