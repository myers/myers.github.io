I heard [Mike Reagan][1] reading this [story about Gore on media and
democracy][2] and laughing because it was condescending (because it criticized
TV?) and old news. But looking at it from the perspective that Gore "put on
his professor's hat for much of the lecture" I think Reagan was just being his
normal partisan self.

I love this quote:

> "Our democracy is suffering in an age when the dominant medium is not
> accessible to the average person and does not lend itself most readily to the
> conveyance of complex ideas about self-governance," Gore said. "Instead it
> pushes toward a lowest common denominator."
