I got a copy of my brother-in-law's music collection while I was in NY last weekend... all 24 GB's of it. He and I had a lot of the same stuff so I made a [TRM fingerprint][1] of all the files in both of our collections and stuck it in a mysql database. Now I'm writing a tool to grade the duplicates using code from [mp3guessenc][2] to discover the encoder used and other mp3 checking tools to see if the file has any errors.

If I could get TuneTagger up and running then I could do it using that. (more on tunetagger later)
