SPCS's internet service is down, yet again. It was down most of last week as well. But here's the dumb thing. The internet is not down, I know, I just connected via ppp and ssh'ed home, but it's their damn proxy servers. And the really dumb thing is I can't set up my own proxy server, because I can't configure the phone to use any other.

Grr...
