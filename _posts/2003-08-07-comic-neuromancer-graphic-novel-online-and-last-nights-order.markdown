Some kind person has put scans of the [Neuromancer graphic novel][1]. It's very 80's looking sci-fi stuff, and only the first 3rd of the book. Since I read Neuromancer in the 1993 my vision of what the book was a little diffrent (and later shaped by the [Johnny Mnemonic movie][2]), but it's intresting to see Gibson to say that's what he was thinking of. 

Also, I did a bit of back issue buying last night... I will soon have all of [Transmetropolitan][3] in some form or another and I can read it front to back.
