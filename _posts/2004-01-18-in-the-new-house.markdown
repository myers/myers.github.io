This friday we closed on our [new house][1]. We moved some stuff in and we are
sleeping there. I'm working at [Shellbook][2] this weekend, but Laura is
painting and unpacking. I have more pictures, but no computer at home to
offload them.

One of the great things about living in Harrisonburg is that we have so many
friends here. Last night we ate Chinese food with Zeke, Jessie, Josh, Mel,
Denver and Keria (the last two we just met), and I was really happy. Plus, 5
minute drive home, versus 1 hour.

Laura met the people moving into our old house. There are really happy with it
and it's a big step up in quality of living for them.
