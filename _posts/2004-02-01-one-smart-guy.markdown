This [interview with AarowSw][1] is probably the most intresting thing I'll
read all day. Great thoughts on the [S-Web][2], tribes in human culture and
just what Arron has been up to.

[later] One thing I would love to have in my [MonoLoco][3] music app is a
feature mentioned at the top "what bands that my friends like are playing
around here in the next week?". The idea would be that the app knows your
friend because you IM program and email program have been creating a
certialized FOAF file for you (hey maybe your phone is bluetoothing info about
how you talk to the most as well), so you can collect who you talk to a lot
(at least via computer). Then MonoLoco knows who you listen to, using
[MusicBrainz][4] identifiers to catalog it. It should also use a yet to be
written feature of Musicbrainz to find the bands homepage, and autodiscover
their RSS file with news (which monoloco will display on screen while you play
that bands songs), and another for tour info.
