<p><em>Got here 15mins late, can&#8217;t read apparently, thought this was at 8:30 not 8</em></p>

<ul>
<li>went though features in Prototype 1.5 (Rail&#8217;s javascript library) (_I wonder how this compares to MochaKit_), and script.aculo.us 1.6</li>
<li>dramatic progress in just one year with this javascript stuff (_it&#8217;s the magic in <span class="caps">AJAX</span> so not too surprising_)</li>
<li>with <span class="caps">RJS</span> you can send <span class="caps">AJAX</span> updates using the Rail&#8217;s partials you already have, just like you did to render the page originally.</li>
<li>You can do a lot of stuff in pure ruby and Prototype will do the right thing on the JS side.  <em>Great idea</em></li>
<li>you can send JS to a page via <code>page &#60;&#60; &#34;js code here&#34;</code></li>
<li>_Someone posted this on the Campfire: <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/article/painless-javascript-prototype_">Painless JavaScript Using Prototype</a></li>
<li><em>Showed demo of <span class="caps">AJAX</span> app he&#8217;s working on <a href="http://www.fluxiom.com/">Fluxiom</a> which is something like a web based, multiuser iPhoto.  After showing the video on the site above intrested in the room went thru the roof and people were hanging on his every word.</em></li>
