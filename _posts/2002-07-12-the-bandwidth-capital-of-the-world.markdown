Wired apparently kicks out a good article once or a while. They used to actually be cool in my book, as two bookshelfs of back issues will attest. While I was living in PNG it was my only connection to the internet news besides a per-kb email account. 

In the Aug 2002 issue they have an article on [broadbands effect on Korea][1], which is utterly facinated to amature anthropologist like myself.
