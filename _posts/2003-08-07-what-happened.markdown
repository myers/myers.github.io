On Tuesday, my friend's ISP where this computer is hosted was hit by lighting. Everything was protected, but it knocked out the power and UPS. So K92 (this computers name) went down. We had LILO as a boot loader and it hung just saying "LI" on the screen. [Steve][1] was too busy with paying work to get to fixing this.

This morning we put the drive in misfit, the mail server and I fsck'ed and then installed GRUB, a mo' betta bootloader, and now everything is happy, and the bunnies jump thru the field.
