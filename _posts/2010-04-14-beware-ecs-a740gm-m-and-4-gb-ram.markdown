My ZFS storage server needed more ram so that I could get the VM's running on it a bit more elbow room.  I got a pair of 4GB 240 Ram chips and they were a no go on the ECS A740GM-M motherboard I have.  Seems that the BIOS screen needs to have the option to remap memory, which it does not.  Too bad the [manufactures page](http://www.ecs.com.tw/ECSWebSite/Products/ProductsDetail.aspx?CategoryID=1&DetailID=864&DetailName=Feature&MenuID=1&LanID=0) for it says it supports up to 16GB
