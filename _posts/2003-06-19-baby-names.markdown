We visited Leanne today, and Laura has been thinking of having kids after seeing 1 year old Elias. Names we've come up for kids (you can't steal these names, or we'll hurt you): 

Boy's Names: 

  * Arthur Kirkland 
  * William Galbrath 
  * Merlin Latimer 

Girl's Names: 

  * Lillian Lane 
  * Mikayla Faye 
  * Madison Graham 

I remember driving between Pauling and Cold Spring with Laura talking about this in the Summer before our wedding.
