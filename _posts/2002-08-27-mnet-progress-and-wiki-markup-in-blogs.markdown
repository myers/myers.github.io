Mnet is moving along, and it should be because I'm pushing hard. The new downloading code, dubbed BlockWrangler is working (look in cvs's HEAD). I'm trying to get the DownloadMonitor code working with it so the GUI gives more feedback.

My blog really needs a Wiki markup filter, so that I can use the much easier to type Wiki markup language in my blog.
