The Hush Tech. [Silent Mini-ITX PC][1] is pretty darn neat. I want one for a set top box. 

What would be better is a case with a dot matrix lcd panel covering the front, front side IR port, and 4 front side usb ports. 

Next you run Freevo (because it's python) and Mnet, and MAME+SNES9X+whatever other game system.
