    [12:10:54] Steve: I played it the other day @ walmart
    [12:10:56] Steve: hah
    [12:11:06] Steve: all these kids were waiting to play.
    [12:11:13] Steve: I just kept playing
    [12:11:24] Steve: "Mommy he wont let me play"
    [12:12:59] Steve: the sales guy asked if I would let the kids play. I asked the parents there
    if they were going to buy a game for the kids. they said no. I said, I probably will not leave
    here w/o buying a game. That shut the salesman up.
