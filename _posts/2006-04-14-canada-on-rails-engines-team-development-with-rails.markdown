<ul>
<li>works at a media buying company, a service.  Not building anything that will be sold.  Dev for many clients simultaneously.</li>
<li>see the same needs across the clients</li>
<li>deals with the most boring problems over and over</li>
<li>reuse code when it solves the same problem, not when it looks for.</li>
<li>these applications are not beautiful and unique snowflakes (_this joke is even better than you think because he looks like brad pitt_)</li>
<li>Generators vs. Engines. _He talked for a while about this which I learned on the <a href="http://rails-engines.org/introduction">Engines Intro</a></li>
<li>Use svn:external to keep engines up to date.</li>
<li>&#8220;it is fun to use ruby for evil&#8221;</li>
<li>engines are plugins but a tiny more that they found useful.</li>
<li>a way to share <span class="caps">MVC</span> slices between apps</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Last night I ate at a Brazilian place with 30 or so Railers.  They serve meat on a sword.  So he <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photo_zoom.gne?id=128465777&#38;context=pool-42074881@N00&#38;size=l">added refs to MeatSword</a> here and there in his slides, including MeatSword.com&#8230;. which is a pr0n site&#8230; hilarity ensues when someone mentions he visited the <span class="caps">URL</span> in a Q&A and everyone loads it in to see for themselves</em></p>

<ul>
<li>wants happy coexistence with Rails Core</li>
</ul>
