I took a [political test][1] (my [exact results][2] if you really must know) which has me has a left leaning Libertarian. Libertarian I know, but _left leaning_? Holy Dittos, Batman! Where did that come from. The only answer I had that was left leaning was a vote for [living wages][3], something have put much thought into. It's funny, I grew up on a missionary base, listening to Rush Limbaugh, hung out with the College Republicans, a bunch of factors that I would think would result in a party line Republican, but now I think I care far more that many people vote and vote intelligently than I care if they vote right or left. And that we ask lots and lots of questions.

[Ted Rawl][4] is very cool. He claims he's way over on the left, but I don't care: he ask very good questions and researches them. Thus [_My Government Went to Afghanistan and All I Got Was This Stupid Pipeline_][5]. I can't say that I've read it all but I'm going to.
