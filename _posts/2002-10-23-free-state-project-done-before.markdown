<p>I&#8217;ve been reading about the <a href="http://www.freestateproject.org/">Free State Project</a> with interest. One interesting note from their <a href="http://www.freestateproject.org/faqs.htm">FAQ</a> talking about if the Feds would stop them in their endeavor:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>However, these tactics [regulations on the sale of property or tightening voter registration requirements] did not stop left-liberals and socialists from taking over Vermont in a coordinated effort.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Poking around on Google for a few minutes I couldn&#8217;t find anything about it&#8230; <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/1.04/eword.html?pg=8">Kibo</a> do you know the answer?</p>
