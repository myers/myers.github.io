From the [OpenMoney Manifesto][1]:

> Money is just information, a way we measure what we trade, nothing of value
in itself. And we can make it ourselves, to work as a complement to
conventional money. Just a matter of design.

>

> There is no good reason for a community to be without money. To be short of
money when there's work to get done is like not having enough inches to build
a house. We have the materials, the tools, the space, the time, the skills and
the intent to build ... but we have no inches today? Why be short of inches?
Why be short of money?

I just keep eyeing the Chaum patent expiration in 2005, and hope I have time
to write some good opensource software around it.
