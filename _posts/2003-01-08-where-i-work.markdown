Someone on IRC was asking about where I work. I realized we have a perfectly good website that does a good job of explaining who or what we are. [Shellbook Publishing Systems][1]

> Shellbook Publishing Systems' core business purpose is the dissemination of life-crucial information to the indigenous people of the world, readable by those people in terms of their own language and culture.

The reason you may want to look at the site is that I'm close to getting them to making a CreativeCommons wizard in the program to allow the content developers pick a CC license to put stuff under. A lot of what we are dealing with is permission to make derivative works, and publishing permissions.
