Today [/.][1] had a [story][2] about certain colleges telling their students that "file sharing" is not allowed over campus networks. So how does these rules apply to Mnet? Part of the design of Mnet is that you can't say any one node is responsible for a file. You don't "share" a file on Mnet, you just let the Mnet software manage part of your hard drive. Little bits and pieces of a file could be on your hard drive, but you'd never know, you can't look, it's encrypted. The idea is that as long two people can pass encrypted messages back and forth, then Mnet could survive. It would be intresting have Mnet run over [ICQ][3] especially with ICQ/TLS or AIM. I imagine there would be some problems getting students not to use IM software.
