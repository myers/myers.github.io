Today I'm attempting to catch up on news. I was at Tate, my family's home on a lake, with no phones/cellphones/internet for a whole week. At first I just going day by day thru [/.][1], opening a tab for each intresting link, but then I had 40 tabs open by the time I got to Wens, and Galeon isn't coping with it very well (100% cpu useage).

The worst news of last week (of what I read so far): [2600 Dropped the DeCSS Case][2]

Best news: Someone with a bit of clue wrote a story on M$ latest attempt to take over the world in [the grey lady][3].
