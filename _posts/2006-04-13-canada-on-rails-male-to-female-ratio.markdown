<p>497:3 and at least one of those 3 looks pretty pissed she&#8217;s here&#8230; at least that&#8217;s what I counted, so it was interesting to see that the organizer had a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/51798472@N00/128117332/in/pool-canadaonrails/">handful good looking women</a> greeting and handing out badges.</p>

<p>This is really bad.  The two genders bring very different perspectives to issues.  Rails is about getting stuff done quickly, not so much about a technology.  I would think this would draw in more woman than than other topics in the CS world.</p>

<p>One of those 3 woman is <a href="http://www.slash7.com/">Amy Hoy</a> who I (over)hear writes great Rails docs and is writing a book.  </p>

<p>Also 24% of Vancouver speak Chinese.  Wild.  You can really see this on the street.</p>
