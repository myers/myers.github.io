On my wishlist is a [Treo 600][1] for which you will be able to add a [SD BlueTooth Card][2]. I **think** the CPU in the Treo could do [ Chuam blinding][3].

From the end user could go to the checkout counter, open the wallet app on his palm, then the store employee could hit the "ecash" button on the register, which would set up a connection with the wallet and the wallet would report to the user how much he is being charged. With the network capablities of the Treo you could download more cash from your bank if you need, transfer money with someone else and check for double spending.
