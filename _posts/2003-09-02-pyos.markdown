When I was visiting aritmage and [itamar][1] in NYC, I put forth the drunken idea of a OS written in Python. Now some silly person is writing [Cleese][2] an OS in python.

I think a neat thing to do with this is have a [capabilities][3] based system to handle OS rights. In this system, a webserver wouldn't be root to bind to a port < 1024, but would get passed a socketobj that was bound to 80 at startup. Also would be given directoryobj for it's docroot. It would be allowed to create new fileobjs/dirobj from that dirobj. Also the docroot dirobj would be missing an entry for ".."
