I've been looking for sample pictures taken with the phone I want, the [Sanyo 8100][1]. I found a few [here][2]. I downloaded them and looked for [EXIF tags][3]: nothing. More silliness. There is a radio clock and and [GPSone][4] (a tech to get gps coordinates from radio towers). Why isn't this stuff embedded in the image?
