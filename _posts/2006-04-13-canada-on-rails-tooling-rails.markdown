<p><a href="http://www.canadaonrails.com/talks/show/3">Tooling Rails</a></p>

<p><em>I have RadRails on my system, it&#8217;s pretty nice.  Used Eclipse at my last job as my primary Java <span class="caps">IDE</span>, so maybe I&#8217;m brain damaged</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Dev include a lot of Mnt. Dew</li>
<li>J2EE require tools to keep up</li>
<li>Rails does not, but can be made better with tools</li>
<li>all comes back to control, with J2EE you give up control, you no longer can figure out what&#8217;s going on.</li>
<li>RadRails is a joke on <span class="caps">RAD</span> systems that take away code, 95% code gen leads to 5% comprehension of system</li>
<li>Less code is not no code</li>
<li>Put the dev in the driver seat, but give him all the buttons he need close on the dashboard</li>
<li><em>Then he gave a demo</em></li>
<li>Lot&#8217;s of interest from the commercial world, just don&#8217;t get it about open source (RadRails is <span class="caps">CPL</span>).</li>
</ul>
