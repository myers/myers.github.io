<p>Firefox (and all other browsers I know) are missing a feature that I would find really useful when I upload stuff via a <span class="caps">HTML</span> form:  How much longer will it take?  There is no progress bar with an <span class="caps">ETA</span>. <a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=253105">There is a bug about this on bugzilla</a>, and I&#8217;d like you to go vote for it.  Maybe if you are a c++ god and have some time you could make a patch.  </p>

<p>Me?  C++ would explode my brain (I know I&#8217;ve tried).</p>
