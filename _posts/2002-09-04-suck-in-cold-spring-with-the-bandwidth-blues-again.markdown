So I'm in NY. A few days here and I've promised myself that I will not leave my house for more that 24 hours unless I get a contract signed in blood that states there will be a less than 250ms, greater than 128Kb/s connection to the net at my destination.

This library has 4 terminals, 3 with no chairs all in front of the main desk. I guess the are trying to stop pr0n viewers from using the computer. There are other computers that use Cybersitter. Wonder if they allow outgoing ssh connections. I was hoping to get some work done here, but I don't think it can be done.
